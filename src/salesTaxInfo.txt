Enclosed is a Java programming problem. We ask that you read the description thoroughly then create a program to solve it. We will evaluate your solution as soon as we receive it. We are assessing a number of things including the design aspect of your solution and your object oriented programming skills.

For the solution, we request that you use Java with JDK7 or later. You may not use any external libraries to solve this problem, but you may use external libraries or tools for building or testing purposes. Specifically, you may use unit testing libraries or build tools available for your chosen language (e.g., JUnit, Maven, Ant, etc.)

!!! IMPORTANT !!! Please use Git to record your changes.

Please also include a brief explanation of your design and assumptions along with your code.

TO SUBMIT YOUR CODE:
1. Please title your submission with example: [code] Sales Taxes, (Your_Name).

2. Attach your solution to the email. PLEASE NOTE: Certain file extensions will be blocked for security purposes. You should NOT include any executable attachments, including those with .exe or .lib extensions.

As a general rule, we allow three days from the date that you receive this letter to submit your code, but you may request more time from your recruiter if needed. If you have any questions about the code as it relates to your interview process, please contact your recruiter.

We wish you luck and look forward to receiving your response.

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROBLEMS

There must be a way to supply the application with the input data via text file. The application must run. You should provide sufficient evidence that your solution is complete by, as a minimum, indicating that it works correctly against the supplied test data. Please note that you will be assessed on your judgment as well as your execution.

PROBLEM: SALES TAXES

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets...
